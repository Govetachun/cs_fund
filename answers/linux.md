# System Engineer/DevOps Interview Questions on Linux Fundamentals and Advanced Linux

## Linux Fundamentals

1. **Filesystem Hierarchy:** What is the Linux filesystem hierarchy, and why is it structured this way?
2. **File Permissions:** How do you manage file permissions and ownership in Linux?
3. **Command-Line Search:** How do you search for files and text within files (e.g., using `find`, `grep`)?
4. **Process Management:** How do you monitor, start, and stop processes in Linux?
5. **Environment Variables:** What are environment variables, and how are they used in Linux?
6. **Links:** What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic (soft) link?
7. **Runlevels vs. systemd Targets:** How do runlevels differ from systemd targets?
8. **Service Management:** How do you manage services using systemd (start, stop, enable, disable)?
9. **Text Processing:** What are the use cases for tools like `awk`, `sed`, and `cut`?
10. **Performance Monitoring:** Which built-in tools can you use to monitor system performance (e.g., `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`)?
11. **/proc Filesystem:** What information can be found in the `/proc` filesystem?
12. **Package Management:** How do package management systems like `apt` and `yum` differ?
13. **Scheduling Tasks:** How do you schedule tasks using `cron` and what are some common pitfalls?

## Advanced Linux Concepts

14. **LVM Management:** What is Logical Volume Management (LVM), and how do you resize logical volumes?
15. **Kernel Tuning:** How do you tune kernel parameters using `sysctl`?
16. **cgroups and Namespaces:** What are cgroups and namespaces, and how do they enable containerization?
17. **Containers vs. VMs:** What are the key differences between containers and virtual machines?
18. **Network Configuration:** How do you configure and troubleshoot network interfaces using tools like `ip` or `ifconfig`?
19. **Security Frameworks:** What roles do SELinux and AppArmor play in Linux security, and how do you manage them?
20. **Kernel Debugging:** How do you diagnose and resolve kernel panics?
21. **Custom Kernel Compilation:** What are the steps involved in compiling and installing a custom Linux kernel?
22. **System Logging:** How do you configure and manage system logging (e.g., using `rsyslog` or `journalctl`)?
23. **Strace Usage:** How can `strace` be used to troubleshoot application issues?
24. **Performance Optimization:** What strategies would you employ to optimize a Linux system for high-performance workloads?
25. **Inotify:** How does inotify work, and in what scenarios would you use it?
26. **Software Repositories:** How do you manage and configure software repositories on a Linux system?
27. **Network Debugging:** What steps do you take to diagnose and fix network connectivity issues in Linux?
28. **Chroot Jails:** What is a chroot jail, and how does it enhance security?
29. **Failover Mechanisms:** How do you implement failover and high availability in a Linux environment?
30. **Automation Best Practices:** What are the best practices for automating Linux server management (e.g., using configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef)?
